# Atlassian MCP Setup - Final Steps

## ✅ What's Done

1. ✅ uv/uvx installed successfully
2. ✅ mcp-atlassian package tested and working
3. ✅ Ready to configure

## 🔑 Step 1: Get Your Jira API Token (3 minutes)

### For Jira Cloud (Ring uses this):

1. Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Name it: "Jira Max MCP"
4. Copy the token (you'll need it in Step 2)

**Save this token somewhere safe!**

## ⚙️ Step 2: Update MCP Configuration (2 minutes)

I'll update your `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` file to add Atlassian MCP.

**You need to provide:**
- Your Jira URL (e.g., `https://jira.atl.ring.com`)
- Your email address
- The API token from Step 1

## 📝 What I Need From You

Please provide:

1. **Jira URL:** `https://_____.atlassian.net` or `https://jira._____.com`
2. **Your Email:** The email you use for Jira
3. **API Token:** The token you just created

Once you give me these, I'll:
1. Update the MCP config
2. Test the connection
3. Show you how to use it

## 🚀 After Setup

You'll be able to use:
- Sprint management
- Worklog tracking
- Issue links/dependencies
- Batch operations
- Version management

All through the Jira Max agent!
